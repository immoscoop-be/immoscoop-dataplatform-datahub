*Functional domain 12 of Data Hub. Overview of all domains: [Functional domains](README.md).*

## Already touched on elsewhere

Pointers to material this domain will build on, collected during the migration. They are navigation, not requirements of this domain.

- [Permissions and user/group management](../../overview/open-themes.md#2-permissions-and-usergroup-management): [OP-DH-22](../../overview/open-themes.md#op-dh-22) to [OP-DH-25](../../overview/open-themes.md#op-dh-25)
- The Library Card for Excel: [DEC-DH-46](../../overview/data-hub.md#dec-dh-46), [DEC-DH-47](../../overview/data-hub.md#dec-dh-47)
- All channels from one Google identity: [DEC-UM-02](02-user-management.md#dec-um-02)
- Role Groups: the [Naming Convention](02-user-management.md#naming-convention) in User management

## Requirements

None yet. Start from the [functional domain template](../_templates/functional-domain.md).

## Open points

- [ ] <a id="op-pl-01"></a>**OP-PL-01** · Work out confidentiality as a concept first, on Confluence, before it becomes requirements here. The starting points of the workshop ([REQ-DH-CONF](../../workshops/2026-10-22-data-agents-and-governance.md#req-dh-conf)): next to its maturity, every Resource gets a level of confidentiality, set in dbt (`meta`), only ever lowered downstream, and taken at its highest by a Lens or a Report, with a matrix of levels against who may do what. Settle as well how it relates to the access classification on the Resource Card ([The Resource Card](../../overview/data-hub.md#the-resource-card)) and to the access axis of [OP-DH-22](../../overview/open-themes.md#op-dh-22). *Decided on 2026-10-22: a concept to work out first, not yet requirements.*

## Builds on

- [Workshop data agents and governance, 2026-10-22](../../workshops/2026-10-22-data-agents-and-governance.md), and its [meeting notes](https://immoscoop.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATA/pages/1378746422) (Confluence, Dutch)
